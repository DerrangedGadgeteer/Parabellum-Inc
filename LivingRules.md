## The Premise of Parabellum Inc.

In a game of Parabellum Inc. you play as a middle manager in a near-future private military corporation.  Your task is to direct company assets to achieve military objectives sent down by The Board of Directors.  You are given a meager budget by The Board with which to purchase, supply, and maintain the assets under your command.  There's nowhere near enough money to go around however, and you must use sucesses on the battlefield to both impress The Board and attract Business Partners to fund your operation.  But be careful: money from outside the company comes with strings attached, and if the debts come due when you can't pay, The Board isn't going to be happy.

Parabellum Inc. is played with miniatures and tokens on a gridded play area, representing Units of soldiers and vehicles, as well as supply lines, on a Battlefield. Play is divided into a series of Battles called a Campaign.  Each Battle consists of a map and a set of Objectives.  Once all the objectives of a Battle have been completed, the player with the most funds selects the next Battle.  A player is eliminated if they end a Battle with no funds, and the winner of a Campaign is the last player with funds remaining.

Each Unit of soldiers a player commands must first be purchased in order to be placed on the map.  Units on the map must also stay supplied in order for them to be able to move or attack.  The player builds Supply Lines by purchasing Supply tokens and placing them on the board, forming a continuous path from their Starting Area to the Unit that needs supply.  But be careful! lines can be attacked by your enemies, and those hard-earned supplies can be destroyed (or worse, captured.)

Each time a player completes an objective, that player gets Bonus Funds from The Board of Directors, allowing them to pay for new units, and to supply their existing ones.  This isn't the only way to acquire funding though.  If a player destroyed an enemy unit, captured or destroyed an enemy's supply line, or completed an objective that turn, that player gets to draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck at the end of their turn.  Business Opportunity Cards can then be played to provide further funding, but either must be repaid, or certain requirements must be met to keep the funds.  Failing to repay or meet the requirements of a Business Opportuinity causes that player to be eliminated.

## Turn-by Turn Gameplay
Players take their turns in order by how much money they have at the beginning of the Battle.  (Ties and the initial Battle's turn order are determined by a dice roll.)

During their turn, a player may: 
- Move any Units they control on the Battlefield
- Attack another player's Units or Supply Lines with their Units
- Complete objectives marked on the Battlefield 
- Purchase new Units
- Purchase Supplies
- Place purchased Units onto the Battlefield at their Start Point
- Place Supplies onto the Battlefield to form Supply Lines
- Resupply Units that are adjacent to friendly Supply Lines
- Make Boardroom Deals to secure Funding for the next turn.

Unless otherwise noted, a player may do these actions in any order on their turn, however all Orders given to a single Unit must be executed all at once. (i.e. a player may not attack with one Unit, move another Unit, and then go back and move the first one.  They'd have to move and attack with the first Unit before moving the second.)  

### Movement
Each unit has a Movement Value and a Fuel Cost.  If a player decides to move a particular unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that unit's Tracking Card equal to its Fuel Cost. (If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't move this turn.) The unit's Movement Value stands for the number of squares the unit can move in one turn.  
>Certain types of Terrain on the Battlefield cost more than 1 Movement Value to enter, and other types of Terrain are Impassible by Certain Units.  Forested and Rocky Terrain costs 2 Movement to enter, while Mountainous Terrain costs 3 Movement to enter and is Impassible to any unit except Infantry.

### Attacking
Each unit has a Battle Die, an Attack Range, and an Ammunition Cost.  If a player decides to Attack with a particular Unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that Unit's Tracking Card equal to its Ammunition Cost.  (If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't Attack this turn.) In order to attack, an Enemy Unit must also be In Range.  A Unit's Attack Range denotes the number of squares away that unit can Attack.

### Objectives
Objectives are signified on the map via special icons, and the specific rules for their requirements are laid out in the Battle's Breifing.  Typically these involve placing a friendly unit on the Objective Square, and keeping it there for the remainder of the Battle.  
> Some Objectives may have other requirements, like destroying them, or recovering them.  See the Battle's Breifing for details.

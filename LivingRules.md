## The Premise of Parabellum Inc.

In a game of Parabellum Inc. you play as a middle manager in a near-future private military corporation.  Your task is to direct company assets to achieve military objectives sent down by The Board of Directors.  You are given a meager budget by The Board with which to purchase, supply, and maintain the assets under your command.  There's nowhere near enough money to go around however, and you must use sucesses on the battlefield to both impress The Board and attract Business Partners to fund your operation.  But be careful: money from outside the company comes with strings attached, and if the debts come due when you can't pay, The Board isn't going to be happy.

Parabellum Inc. is played with miniatures and tokens on a gridded play area, representing Units of soldiers and vehicles, as well as supply lines, on a Battlefield. Play is divided into a series of Battles called a Campaign.  Each Battle consists of a map and a set of Objectives.  Once all the objectives of a Battle have been completed, the player with the most funds selects the next Battle.  A player is eliminated if they end a Battle with no funds, and the winner of a Campaign is the last player with funds remaining.

Each Unit of soldiers a player commands must first be purchased in order to be placed on the map.  Units on the map must also stay supplied in order for them to be able to move or attack.  The player builds Supply Lines by purchasing Supply tokens and placing them on the board, forming a continuous path from their Starting Area to the Unit that needs supply.  But be careful! lines can be attacked by your enemies, and those hard-earned supplies can be destroyed (or worse, captured.)

Each time a player completes an objective, that player gets Bonus Funds from The Board of Directors, allowing them to pay for new units, and to supply their existing ones.  This isn't the only way to acquire funding though.  If a player destroyed an enemy unit, captured or destroyed an enemy's supply line, or completed an objective, that player gets to draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck at the end of their turn.  Business Opportunity Cards can then be played to provide further funding, but either must be repaid, or certain requirements must be met to keep the funds.  Failing to repay or meet the requirements of a Business Opportuinity causes that player to be eliminated.

## Turn-by Turn Gameplay

Players take their turns in order by how much money they have at the beginning of the Battle.  (Ties and the initial Battle's turn order are determined by a dice roll.)

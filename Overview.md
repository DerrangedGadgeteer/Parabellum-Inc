## The Premise of Parabellum Inc.

In a game of Parabellum Inc. you play as a middle manager in a near-future private military corporation.  Your task is to direct company assets to achieve military objectives sent down by The Board of Directors.  You are given a meager budget by The Board with which to purchase, supply, and maintain the assets under your command.  There's nowhere near enough money to go around however, and you must use sucesses on the battlefield to both impress The Board and attract Business Partners to fund your operation.  But be careful: money from outside the company comes with strings attached, and if the debts come due when you can't pay, The Board isn't going to be happy.

Parabellum Inc. is played with miniatures and tokens on a gridded play area, representing Units of soldiers and vehicles, as well as supply lines, on a Battlefield. Play is divided into a series of Battles called a Campaign.  Each Battle consists of a map and a set of Objectives.  Once all the objectives of a Battle have been completed, the player with the most funds selects the next Battle.  A player is eliminated if they end a Battle with no funds and outstanding Liabilities, and the winner of a Campaign is the last player with funds remaining.

The type and position of each Unit is represented on the map by a miniature with a colored flag.  The other attributes of each unit is represented by a tracking card which matches the colored flag of the Unit's Mini.  

> Each unit card tracks (using Tokens): 
> - Troop Strength, representing the health and combat strength of the Unit.
> - Supplies, representing the fuel and ammunition supplies of the Unit.
>   
> Each Unit card also shows:
> - The Unit's type, with an illustration for flavor
> - The Unit's Purchase Price, self explanatory
> - The Unit's Extraction Cost, Indicating how much it will cost to move the unit from the board into reserve so it can be sold or kept into the next Battle
> - The Unit's Movement Speed, indicating how many grid cells that Unit can move during its turn
> - The Unit's Battle Die, indicating the kind of die the unit rolls when Attacking or Defending from an Attack
> - Any special attributes for the Unit, including:
>   - whether it is Land, Naval, or an Air Unit
>   - If the unit is an Indirect Fire Unit
>   - If the unit can be initially placed outside the player's Starting Area.

Each Unit of soldiers a player commands must first be purchased on the Market in order to be placed on the map.  Units on the map must also stay supplied in order for them to be able to move or attack.  The player must build Supply Lines, forming a continuous path from their Starting Area to the Unit that needs supply.  But be careful! lines can be attacked by your enemies, and those hard-earned supplies can be destroyed (or worse, captured.)

If a player completes an objective, that player gets Bonus Funds from The Board of Directors once the Battle is over. This funding allows them to pay for new units, and to supply their existing ones.  This isn't the only way to acquire funding though.  During play, if a player destroyed an enemy unit, captured or destroyed an enemy's supply line, or completed an objective that turn, that player gets to draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck at the end of their turn.  Business Opportunity Cards can then be played to provide further funding, but either must be repaid, or certain requirements must be met to keep the funds.  Failing to repay or meet the requirements of a Business Opportuinity causes that player to be eliminated.

## Turn-by Turn Gameplay
Players take their turns in order by how much money they have at the beginning of the Battle.  (Ties and the initial Battle's turn order are determined by a dice roll.)

Each turn is divided into 2 Phases: 

The [Combat Phase](./CombatPhase), where players: 
- Place purchased Units onto the Battlefield at their Start Point
- Place Supplies onto the Battlefield to form Supply Lines
- Resupply Units that are adjacent to friendly Supply Lines
- Move any Units they control on the Battlefield
- Attack another player's Units or Supply Lines with their Units
- Complete objectives marked on the Battlefield

And the [Boardroom Phase](./BoardroomPhase), where players: 
- Purchase new Units
- Purchase Supplies
- Extract Units from their Starting Area
- Tear Down Supply Lines, returning supplies to Reserve
- Sell Units and Supplies they don't need
- Draw and play Business Opportunity Cards

A player may do these actions in any order during the applicable phase, however all Orders given to a single Unit must be executed all at once. (i.e. a player may not attack with one Unit, move another Unit, and then go back and move the first one.  They'd have to move and attack with the first Unit before moving the second.)  

### Movement
Each unit has a Movement Value and a Fuel Cost.  If a player decides to move a particular unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that unit's Tracking Card equal to its Fuel Cost. (If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't move this turn.) The unit's Movement Value stands for the number of squares the unit can move in one turn.  
>Certain types of Terrain on the Battlefield cost more than 1 Movement Value to enter, and other types of Terrain are Impassible by Certain Units.  Forested and Rocky Terrain costs 2 Movement to enter, while Mountainous Terrain costs 3 Movement to enter and is Impassible to any unit except Infantry.

### Attacking
Each unit has a Battle Die, Troop Strength, an Attack Range, and an Ammunition Cost.  If a player decides to Attack with a particular Unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that Unit's Tracking Card equal to its Ammunition Cost.  
> If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't Attack this turn.

In order to attack, an Enemy Unit must also be In Range.  A Unit's Attack Range denotes the number of squares away that unit can Attack.  Each Unit's Battle Die denotes how powerful the Unit is in Combat, while its Troop Strength represents both the "health" of the unit, and the number of dice that Unit will get to roll in combat.  

When an Attack is declared, the Attacking player collects a number of that Unit's Battle dice equal to that Unit's Troop Strength.  The defending player collects a number of the Attacked Unit's Battle Dice equal to the Attacked Unit's Troop Strength.  Both players then roll their collected dice and compare values.  For each of the Defending Unit's Battle Dice that meet or exceed an Attacking Unit's die, the Defender can remove one Attacking Die, along with the Defending Die that matches it.  After doing so, any remaining dice the Attacker has become Losses inflicted upon the Defending Unit's Troop Strength.  

After concluding an attack, the defending player must reduce the Troop Strength of their attacked unit by the number of losses.  If the defending unit is reduced to zero Troop Strength, the unit is destroyed, its mini is removed from the map, and its card, along with all supplies on it is discarded.  

>If the Defending Unit has sufficient Supplies, and if the Attacking unit is within the Defending Unit's Range, the Defending player may choose to expend the supplies and Counterattack.  The Counterattack is processed mostly like the attack, except the roles of attacker and defender are reversed.

>If an enemy unit is in range of an attacking unit, and also in range of a friendly Indirect Fire unit tht hasn't fired this turn, the attacking unit may instead Call In an attack from the Indirect Fire Unit.  In doing so, the attacking unit doesn't expend any Supplies, and instead the Indirect Fire Unit expends supplies and makes the attack in the Attacking Unit's stead.  In this case, the Indirect Fire Unit's Attack Die and Troop Strength are used, and there is no opportunity for a Counterattack after Losses are figured.

### Objectives
Objectives are signified on the map via special icons, and the specific rules for their requirements are laid out in the Battle's Breifing.  Typically these involve placing a friendly unit on the Objective Square, and keeping it there for the remainder of the Battle.  
> Some Objectives may have other requirements, like destroying them, or recovering them.  See the Battle's Breifing for details.

### Purchasing Units and Supplies
If a player has the necessary funds, they may purchase Supply Tokens and new Units from the Market. New Units are placed in an area beside the Battlefield called the Reserve, and may be Deployed onto the Battlefield during the player's next turn.  Supply Tokens are kept on hand by the player, and can be played immediately, either to build out the player's supply lines, or to resupply their units.  
> See the Deployment and Supply sections for details.

### Deploying Units
Units a player has in Reserve can be moved onto the Battlefield the turn after they were placed into Reserve.  Units Deployed this way can be placed onto the player's Deployment Area marked on the Battlefield. Transport Aircraft Units allow a player to place Deployed Troops freely onto the map (at risk of provoking anti-aircraft retaliation.) Orbital Insertion Units come with a significant additional cost, but can be Deployed to any point on the map.  

### Extraction
Any time a player has a Unit on their Deployment Area, they may pay a fee to Extract that Unit.  By Extracting that Unit, they move the Unit from the Battlefield to their Reserve.  At the end of a Battle as well, a player may chose to pay the Extraction Cost of any Units on the Battlefield that aren't occupying an Objective.  Units Extracted this way, as well as all other Units and Supplies in Reserve, can be carried over to the next Battle.  Whereas Units and supplies left on the Battlefield are Lost.

### Supplies and Supply Lines
Units require supplies to Move, Attack, and Counterattack.  Supplies are represented by Supply Tokens, which the player purchases and keeps in Reserve until Played.  Each Supply Token can be used in one of two ways:
- To Resupply a Unit that has its supplies depleted
- To Build Out a player's Supply Lines

Each Unit has a Supply Capacity, denoted on the Unit's Tracking Card by a grid of squares.  Each time the Unit Moves, Attacks, or Counterattacks, the player must remove the appropriate number of Supply Tokens from the Card. If the Unit is adjacent to it's player's Supply Lines, that player may (instead of moving or attacking,) move supplies from their Reserves to the Unit's Card to replenish the spent supplies.
The Player's Supply Lines are denoted by Supply Tokens instead being placed onto the board.  The Player may place supply tokens adjacent to their Deployment Area, or adjacent to any other supply token they've placed onto the board already.  However, newly placed Supply Tokens must form a chain (The Supply Line) all the way back to the player's Deployment Area. (I.e. Supply Tokens that are cut off from the Deployment area cannot have new supply tokens placed next to them except to reconnect them to the Deployment Area.) The player can place up to as many Supply Tokens as they have in Reserve, but they may not place Tokens they just purchased this turn.  

### Boardroom Dealings
If a player managed to Destroy an enemy Unit, Capture an Objective, Capture or Destroy enemy supplies, at the conclusion of their turn, that player gets to draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck and place it into their hand.  

Business Opportunity Cards represent sources of Funds that players can play to generate capital with which they can buy Units and Supplies.  However the funds generated by playing Business Opportunity Cards have Contingincies which the player is liable as long as the card is in play.
> The Basic types of Business Opportunity are:
> - Lines of Credit: An upfront influx of cash which must be paid back with interest at the end of the current Battle.
> - Sponsorships: Free Units that must be returned at the end of the current battle, and for which losses must be paid for.
> - Investors: An upfront influx of cash which doesn't need to be paid back, but for which the player must pay a dividend at the end of each battle.

The Player may hold 5 Business Opportunity Cards in their hand.  If they draw one with a full hand, they must either play one, or discard one from their hand by shuffling it back into the Business Opportunity Deck.  

Each Player may, at any time, place a Business Opportunity Card from their Hand, face-up into their Reserve Area.  Upon doing so, that player adds the Card's value of Funds to their own coffers.    

Each Business Opportunity card has a Payoff Cost, which if paid back to the Market, allows the player to remove the card from their reserve area and shuffle it back into the business opportunity deck.  The player no longer has to pay the liabilities of cards Paid Off this way.

## Inter-Battle Play
At the end of each Battle, each player must reconcile their funds and liabilities.  First, the player recieves any Completion Bonus they may have earned from completing Objectives during the Battle, then all Business Opportunity Cards' Contingincies must be resolved.  If the player doesn't have enough funds to meet their Business Opportunity Cards' Contingincies, they must either sell units & Supplies they have in Reserve, or they must play any Business Opportunity Cards they have available in their hand.

> Business Opportunity Cards played between Battles have their Contingincies come due at the end of the next Battle.

If a player has sold all units and supplies in their Reserves, and played all Business Opportunity Cards in their hand, and still doesn't have enough funds to pay their Contingincies, that player is Bankrupt and eliminated.

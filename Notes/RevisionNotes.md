### To Simplify Indirect fire, spotting, and balance combat:
- Only 3 kinds of dice... D4, D8, D12 (Maybe D6, D8, D10 if that's too swingy.)
- Indirect fire units don't attack by themselves
  - Direct combat units "Call in" indirect fires on units they threaten instead of attacking that turn.
  - If there's air, navy, or artillery units in range, then the attack can be made.
  - Mortar, Helicopter, and Costal Boat, D8
  - Artillery, Airstrike, Battleship, D12

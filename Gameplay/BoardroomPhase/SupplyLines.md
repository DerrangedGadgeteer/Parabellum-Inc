# Building Supply Lines
The Player's Supply Lines are denoted by Supply Tokens instead being placed onto the board.  The Player may place supply tokens adjacent to their Deployment Area, or adjacent to any other supply token they've placed onto the board already.  However, newly placed Supply Tokens must form a chain (The Supply Line) all the way back to the player's Deployment Area. (I.e. Supply Tokens that are cut off from the Deployment area cannot have new supply tokens placed next to them except to reconnect them to the Deployment Area.) The player can place up to as many Supply Tokens as they have in Reserve, but they may not place Tokens they just purchased this turn.

# Movement
Each unit has a Movement Value and a Fuel Cost.  If a player decides to move a particular unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that unit's Tracking Card equal to its Fuel Cost. (If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't move this turn.) The unit's Movement Value stands for the number of squares the unit can move in one turn.  
>Certain types of Terrain on the Battlefield cost more than 1 Movement Value to enter, and other types of Terrain are Impassible by Certain Units.  Forested and Rocky Terrain costs 2 Movement to enter, while Mountainous Terrain costs 3 Movement to enter and is Impassible to any unit except Infantry.

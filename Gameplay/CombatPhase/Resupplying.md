# Resupplying

Each Unit has a Supply Capacity, denoted on the Unit's Tracking Card by a grid of squares.  Each time the Unit Moves, Attacks, or Counterattacks, the player must remove the appropriate number of Supply Tokens from the Card. If the Unit is adjacent to it's player's Supply Lines, that player may (instead of moving or attacking,) move supplies from their Reserves to the Unit's Card to replenish the spent supplies.

# Attacking
Each unit has a Battle Die, Troop Strength, an Attack Range, and an Ammunition Cost.  If a player decides to Attack with a particular Unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that Unit's Tracking Card equal to its Ammunition Cost.  
> If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't Attack this turn.

In order to attack, an Enemy Unit must also be In Range.  A Unit's Attack Range denotes the number of squares away that unit can Attack.  Each Unit's Battle Die denotes how powerful the Unit is in Combat, while its Troop Strength represents both the "health" of the unit, and the number of dice that Unit will get to roll in combat.  

When an Attack is declared, the Attacking player collects a number of that Unit's Battle dice equal to that Unit's Troop Strength.  The defending player collects a number of the Attacked Unit's Battle Dice equal to the Attacked Unit's Troop Strength.  Both players then roll their collected dice and compare values.  For each of the Defending Unit's Battle Dice that meet or exceed an Attacking Unit's die, the Defender can remove one Attacking Die, along with the Defending Die that matches it.  After doing so, any remaining dice the Attacker has become Losses inflicted upon the Defending Unit's Troop Strength.  

After concluding an attack, the defending player must reduce the Troop Strength of their attacked unit by the number of losses.  If the defending unit is reduced to zero Troop Strength, the unit is destroyed, its mini is removed from the map, and its card, along with all supplies on it is discarded.  

>If the Defending Unit has sufficient Supplies, and if the Attacking unit is within the Defending Unit's Range, the Defending player may choose to expend the supplies and Counterattack.  The Counterattack is processed mostly like the attack, except the roles of attacker and defender are reversed.

>If an enemy unit is in range of an attacking unit, and also in range of a friendly Indirect Fire unit tht hasn't fired this turn, the attacking unit may instead Call In an attack from the Indirect Fire Unit.  In doing so, the attacking unit doesn't expend any Supplies, and instead the Indirect Fire Unit expends supplies and makes the attack in the Attacking Unit's stead.  In this case, the Indirect Fire Unit's Attack Die and Troop Strength are used, and there is no opportunity for a Counterattack after Losses are figured.

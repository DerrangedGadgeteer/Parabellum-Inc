# Inter-Battle Play
At the end of each Battle, each player must reconcile their funds and liabilities.  First, each player recieves any Completion Bonus they may have earned from completing Objectives during the Battle. Second, all Business Opportunity Cards' Contingincies must be resolved.  If the player doesn't have enough funds to meet their Business Opportunity Cards' Contingincies, they must either sell units & Supplies they have in Reserve, or they must play any Business Opportunity Cards they have available in their hand.

> Note: Business Opportunity Cards played between Battles have their Contingincies come due at the end of the **next** Battle.

If a player has sold all units and supplies in their Reserves, played all Business Opportunity Cards in their hand, and still doesn't have enough funds to pay their Contingincies, that player is Bankrupt and eliminated.  

Once all Contingincies have been resolved, the player with the most Credits may select the next Battle from the Campaign Map Pack.  Change out the Map for the one selected, and another [Build-Up Phase](./InitialSetup.md#"Build-Up-Phase") begins.  

> Note: There are a couple differences between an Inter-Battle Build-Up and the Initial Build-Up.
> - Players may play any Business Opportunity Cards they have remaining to allow them to purchase more Units and Supplies.
> - Any Units a player has in Reserve are kept between Battles, and can be Resupplied, Redeployed, Resold, and/or Repaired during this Build-Up Phase
> - Turn order is decided by the player who selected the next Battle

### Optional Rule: Sub-Contracting

> Note: This rule is intended to engage players who have been eliminated, who wish to play for only part of a Campaign, or who arrive late to the game, however it will likely extend the length of play.

If a player has gone Bankrupt and has been eliminated but wishes to continue play, another player may Sub-Contract that player during the Inter-Battle Phase.  Late arriving players and guest players may also be Sub-Contracted this way.  To Sub-Contract a player, during the Inter-Battle Build-Up Phase a player with funds available can offer the prospective Sub-Contractor a Down-Payment of Credits, a Mission Objective, and a Completion Award.  

The amount of the Down-Payment is offered at the option of the Patron Player, and with it, the Subcontractor must purchase new Units and Supplies with the purpose of completing the requested Objective.  

The Mission Objective can be either:
- The Delegation of one of the upcoming Battle's Objectives
  - If the Subcontractor completes the Delegated Objective, then the agreed upon Completion Award becomes a Contingency for the Patron
  - If the Subcontractor fails to complete the Delegated Objective, or if the Patron completes the Objective before the Subcontractor, then the Patron is not obligated to pay the Completion Award.
  - In either case, the Completion Bonus tied to the Objective by the Battle is paid to the Patron.
- An Arbitrary Objective set by the patron
  - An Arbitrary goal must be specific and quantifiable from the state of the game board. For instance:
    - Destroy a certain number of enemy units
    - Prevent the entry of enemy units within a specific area of the map
    - Protect specific Units for the duration of the Battle
  - If the Subcontractor Completes the exact letter of the Patron's Arbitrary Objective, then the Completion Award becomes a Contingency for the Patron.  
  - If the Subcontractor fails to complete the exact letter of the Patron's Arbitrary Objective, then the Patron is not obligated to pay the Completion Award.

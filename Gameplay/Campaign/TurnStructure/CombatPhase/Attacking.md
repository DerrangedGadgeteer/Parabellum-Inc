# Attacking

Each unit has an Ammunition Cost, a Battle Die, and an Attack Range indicated on their Unit Tracking Card.  The Ammunition Cost indicates how many Supply Tokens must be spent from the Unit's Supplies in order to attack.  The Battle Die represents the Unit's ability to do damage, and indicates what kind of die is rolled when an attack is made.  The Attack Range indicates how many squares away the unit can attack.  Attack Range, like Movement, is figured orthogonally.  As such, the four squares adjacent to the unit are considered 1 square away, the four diagonal squares and the next 4 squares further orthogonally are 2, etc.

Each unit also has statistics called Troop Strength, and Supplies which are tracked on the unit's tracking card using Troop and Supply Tokens respectively.  The Troop Strength count ranges between 0 and 10, and represents the amount of lossses the unit has suffered.  Mechanically speaking, the Troop Strength indicates the number of Battle Dice the unit gets to roll when attacking or defending from an attack.  Supplies represent the available fuel and ammunition carried by the unit, and Attacking shares its resource pool with Movement.

If a player decides to Attack an enemy unit in Range, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that Unit's Tracking Card equal to its Ammunition Cost.  

> If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't Attack this turn.

When an Attack is declared, the Attacking player collects a number of that Unit's Battle dice equal to that Unit's Troop Strength.  The defending player collects a number of their Attacked Unit's Battle Dice equal to the Attacked Unit's Troop Strength.  Both players then roll their collected dice and compare values.  For each of the Defending Unit's Battle Dice that meet or exceed an Attacking Unit's die, the Defender can remove one Attacking Die, along with the Defending Die that matches it.  After doing so, any remaining dice the Attacker has become Losses inflicted upon the Defending Unit's Troop Strength.  

> Insert Example Here

After concluding an attack, the defending player must reduce the Troop Strength of their attacked unit by the number of losses.  If the defending unit is reduced to zero Troop Strength, the unit is destroyed, its mini is removed from the map, and its card, along with all supplies on it is discarded.  

## Counterattacking

After Losses are calculated and the defending Unit's Troop Strength is reduced by that number,  the Defending player may choose to Counterattack.  The Defending Unit must have sufficient Supplies, and the Attacking unit must be within the Defending Unit's Range for a Counterttack to go forward.  The Counterattack is processed mostly like the attack, except the roles of attacker and defender are reversed.  The Counterattacker spends Supply Tokens, rolls as many Battle Dice as their remaining Troop Strength will allow against the (now defending) attacker.  Dice are matched and losses are figured the same as a regular attack.

> Counterattacks don't provoke Counter-Counterattacks.  An attack is declared, dice are rolled, losses figured, then the Counterattack is declared, dice are rolled, losses are figured, and then the combat is concluded.

## Calling In Artillery

If an enemy unit is in range of your unit, and also in range of a friendly Indirect Fire unit tht hasn't fired this turn, the attacking unit may instead "Call In" an attack from the Indirect Fire Unit.  In doing so, the attacking unit doesn't expend any Supplies, and instead the Indirect Fire Unit expends supplies and makes the attack in the Attacking Unit's stead.  In this case, the Indirect Fire Unit's Attack Die and Troop Strength are used, and there is no opportunity for a Counterattack after Losses are figured.

> See: Artillery

## Calling In Air Support

If you control any Ground-Attack Aircraft, you may also use one of your units to Call In an Air Strike.  Similar to calling in Artillery, the enemy Unit must be in range of your spotting Unit, but all squares on the map are in range for an aircraft.  The Aircraft must expend both its Fuel **and** Ammunition Cost's worth of Supplies in order to complete an Air Strike, and again, like Artillery, there is no opportunity for a Counterattack.

> See: Air Support

## Attacking Supply Lines

If your unit is within range of Enemy Supply Line Tokens on the map, you may instead choose to attack those Supply Lines.  If you do so, you spend the same Ammunition Cost worth of your supplies, and you get to remove a number of your opponent's supply line tokens from the board according the following chart:

| Battle Die | Max Tokens Removed |
| - | - |
| D4 | 1 |
| D8 | 2 |
| D12 | 3 |

All Tokens removed this way must be in range of the Attacking Unit, and Tokens removed this way are destroyed.  Artillery and Air Strikes can be used to attack supply lines as well.

### Capturing Supplies

Infantry-type Units can also Capture Enemy or derelict Supply Tokens.  This is done during movement, but is covered here for clarity.  If an Infantry Unit moves onto a square with an Enemy or Derelict Supply Token, the Token can be captured, removing it from the map and placing it into the Unit's own Supplies.

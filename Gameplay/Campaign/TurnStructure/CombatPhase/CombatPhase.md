#Combat Phase

Each player's turn begins with the Combat Phase

During the Combat Phase, the player can:
> - [Move their Units](./Movement.md)
> - [Attack Enemy Units](./Attacking.md)
> - [Deploy Units](./Deployment.md) from their Reserve
> - [Extract Units](./Deployment.md#Extraction) from their Starting Area
> - [Resupply Units](./Resupplying.md)
> - [Build out Supply Lines](./Resupplying.md#SupplyLines)
> - [Capture Objectives](./CapturingObjectives.md) on the map

Once the player has completed all of their Combat Phase actions for this turn, they proceed to the [Boardroom Phase](../BoardroomPhase/BoardroomPhase.md)

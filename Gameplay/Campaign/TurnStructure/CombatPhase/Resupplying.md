# Resupplying

Each Unit has a Supply Capacity, denoted on the Unit's Tracking Card by a grid of squares.  Each time the Unit Moves, Attacks, or Counterattacks, the player must remove the appropriate number of Supply Tokens from the Card. If the Unit is adjacent to it's player's Supply Lines, that player may (instead of moving or attacking,) move supplies from their Reserves to the Unit's Card to replenish the spent supplies.

# Supply Lines

In order to Resupply units in the field, the Units must be on or adjacent to a Supply Line.  Supply lines are built by placing Supply Tokens onto the map from your Reserves.  (Instead of using them to Resupply Units.)  These Tokens however must be placed either next to your Deployment Area, or next to another Supply Line Token forming a chain eventually reaching back to your deployment area.  Supply Lines can not be built on any squares that require more than 1 Movement to enter.  Finally, squares with Supply Tokens on them can be moved through and landed on by both your and your opponent's Units.  

# Consolidation and Scrounging

You May also Consolidate your supply lines, removing them from the board and placing them back in your reserves.  ~~You may not however, both place and remove Supply Tokens from the board in the same turn.  You must **either** build out your Supply Lines, **or** Consolidate them.~~  Consolidated Supplies however, suffer from waste.  And for each 2 supply tokens removed from your Supply Lines, you get to place only 1 into your reserves. 

If you have a unit on or adjacent to Supplies you intend to Consolidate, you may also have that Unit Scrounge supplies.  If you do, you can (in lieu of Resupplying the Unit this turn,) place any Supply Tokens adjacent to or beneath it onto that Unit's Tracking Card.

# Derelict Supplies

If an Enemy Attack destroys a Supply Token that cuts off part of your Supply Line, those Supplies that no longer reach back to your Deployment Area are considered Derelict.  Derelict Supplies are free to be captured or scrounged by any unit adjacent to them.  If you place Supply Tokens and extend your Supply Lines to reach a chain of Derelict Supplies, those Supplies become part of your Supply Lines.  But besides connecting them to their supply lines, no player can build their supply lines off of Derelict Supplies.  

# Capturing Map Features

The final important function of Supplies is to complete the process of Capturing a map objective.  If you extend your Supply Lines to a Map feature that you've Secured with one of your Units, that Feature is considered Captured.

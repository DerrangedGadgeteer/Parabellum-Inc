# Deploying Units

If a player has units in their Reserves, they may Deploy them any time during their Combat Phase.  Deployment involves moving the unit's Mini from the Reserve Area onto the board.  Normal Units can only be placed onto the board in empty squares of the controlling player's Deployment Area (indicated on the map.)  Deployed Units must wait until the next turn in order to move.  This imposes a limit on how many Units a player can place in a single turn.   

Certain Special Units such as Paratroops and Orbital Marines can be Deployed outside the player's Deployment Area, and the specifics of where such Units can be Deployed, and under what conditions will be outlined on the Unit's Tracking Card.

# Extraction

If a player moves one of their units onto their own Deployment Area, the player may pay its Extraction Cost and move the unit off the board and into their Reserves.  The Extraction Cost is listed on the Unit's Tracking Card, and represents the logistical cost of getting the Unit and all their equipment back off-world. 

A player may do this to clear their Deployment Area for new Units, to save some of their units for the next Battle, to Repair damaged units, or to Sell Off Units they don't need for extra Credits. And Extraction is also necessary for completing Extraction Objectives.

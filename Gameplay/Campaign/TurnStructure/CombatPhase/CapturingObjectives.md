# Securing, Capturing, and Extracting Objectives

Each Battle Map has a unique set of objectives associated with it. There are two basic types of Objective: 
- Capture Objectives
- Extraction Objectives

There will be Special Objectives that don't conform to these two archetypes, but the exact requirements of such Special Objectives will be outlined in the accompanying Battle Map notes.

## Securing and Capturing

If a Battle Map has special squares designated as Objectives to be Captured, then in order to complete that Objective, there are two requirements:  

First, the Objective must be Secured by moving at least one Unit onto it.  At least one of the Units must be an Infantry type, and enemy Units must be kept out of the Objective's squares.  If an unfriendly Unit enters one of the Objective's squares, the Objective is no longer considered Secured, and is instead considered Contested.  Contested Objectives do not provide either Occupying player with the benefits that Objective offers.  If a player has extended their Supply Lines to a Contested Objective, they cannot use the Objective as a Deployment Area, or as an extension of their supply chain until they've expelled or destroyed all enemy Units within the Objective and rendered it Secure once again.  

Once an objective has been Secured, it can be completely Captured by connecting it to the Capturing Player's Supply Lines.  In addition to any Map-Specific benefits the Objective offers when captured, starting next turn, the squares of an Objective can be treated as if they were an extra Deployment Area.  Meaning Supply Lines can be built out from the Objective squares, Units can be deployed from reserves into the Objective's squares, Units can be Extracted from the Objective Squares, etc.  As long as the Objective is both Secured and connected to the player's Supply Lines, then the Objective is considered Captured for the purpose of End-of-Battle Bonuses, and once all Objectives on the map are Captured, the Battle ends.  

If an Objective which has been captured becomes Contested by the presence of an Enemy Unit, the Objective is no longer considered Captured.  However, if the Supply Line Connection isn't broken, then the Objective will be considered Recaptured as soon as all enemy Units are removed.  If an Objective which has been captured is abandoned by the Units Securing it, the Objective is still considered Captured so long as no enemy units enter it.  Likewise, a captured Objective whose supply line is cut is still considered Captured until an enemy Unit contests it.  In any of these cases however, the Objective cannot be used as part of the player's Supply lines, or as a Deployment Area until both the Securing Infantry Unit and the Supply Line connection are restored.  If, on the other hand, both the Securing Unit leaves (or is destroyed) **and** the Supply Line is Cut, the Objective is no longer considered Captured at all.

## Securing and Extracting

If a battle Map has an Extraction Objective, then a special Extraction Token is to be placed onto the Board in the prescribed place.

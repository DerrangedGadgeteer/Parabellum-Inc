# Securing, Capturing, and Extracting Objectives

Each Battle Map has a unique set of objectives associated with it. There are two basic types of Objective: 
- Capture Objectives
- Extraction Objectives

There will be Special Objectives that don't conform to these two archetypes, but the exact requirements of such Special Objectives will be outlined in the accompanying Battle Map notes.

## Securing and Capturing

If a Battle Map has special squares designated as Objectives to be Captured, then in order to complete that Objective, there are two requirements:  

First, the Objective must be Secured by moving at least one Unit onto it.  At least one of the Units must be an Infantry type, and enemy Units must be kept out of the Objective's squares.  If an unfriendly Unit enters one of the Objective's squares, the Objective is no longer considered Secured, and is instead considered Contested.  Contested Objectives do not provide either Occupying player with the benefits that Objective offers.  If a player has extended their Supply Lines to a Contested Objective, they cannot use the Objective as a Deployment Area, or as an extension of their supply chain until they've expelled or destroyed all enemy Units within the Objective and rendered it Secure once again.  

Once an objective has been Secured, it can be completely Captured by connecting it to the Capturing Player's Supply Lines.  In addition to any Map-Specific benefits the Objective offers when captured, starting next turn, the squares of an Objective can be treated as if they were an extra Deployment Area.  Meaning Supply Lines can be built out from the Objective squares, Units can be deployed from reserves into the Objective's squares, Units can be Extracted from the Objective Squares, etc.  As long as the Objective is both Secured and connected to the player's Supply Lines, then the Objective is considered Captured for the purpose of End-of-Battle Bonuses, and once all Objectives on the map are Captured, the Battle ends.  

> If an Objective which has been captured becomes Contested by the presence of an Enemy Unit, the Objective is no longer considered Captured.  However, if the Supply Line Connection isn't broken, then the Objective will be considered Recaptured as soon as all enemy Units are removed.  If an Objective which has been captured is abandoned by the Units Securing it, the Objective is still considered Captured so long as no enemy units enter it.  Likewise, a captured Objective whose supply line is cut is still considered Captured until an enemy Unit contests it.  In any of these cases however, the Objective cannot be used as part of the player's Supply lines, or as a Deployment Area until both the Securing Infantry Unit and the Supply Line connection are restored.  If, on the other hand, both the Securing Unit leaves (or is destroyed) **and** the Supply Line is Cut, the Objective is no longer considered Captured at all.

## Securing and Extracting

If a battle Map has an Extraction Objective, then a special two-sided Extraction Token is to be placed onto the Board in the prescribed place.  The Extraction Token represents a person or object that needs to be removed from the Battlefield.  As long as the Extraction Token is on the Battle Map, it's treated the same as a Derelict Supply Line Token.  

To complete an Extraction Objective, the Extraction Token must be Secured, and then Extracted.  To secure an Extraction Token, the player must move an Infantry-type Unit onto the square with the Token, and then instead of attacking this turn, the player may move the Extraction Token off the Map, and onto the Unit's Tracking Card.  On the Unit tracking Card, an Extraction Token takes the place of 4 Supply Tokens. The Unit with the Extraction Token must then proceed to its player's Deployment Area to be Extracted.  (See: [Extracting Units](./Deployment.md#Extraction) )  Once the Unit's been Extracted, the Objective is considered Complete. 

> If the Unit doesn't have 4 empty Supply Token squares, then Supply Tokens will have to be discarded until there's room.
> A Unit carrying an Extraction Token cannot initiate any Attacks. (Though it can Counterattack if Attacked.)
> A unit carrying an Extraction Token can Offload the Extraction token if necessary, transferring the token from the Unit's card, either to the Battle Map under the carrying Unit, or directly into the Supplies of an adjacent Infatry-Type Unit.  

If a Unit carrying an Extraction Token is Destroyed, then the Extraction Token is flipped to its 2nd side and placed back on the Map where the carrying unit had been.  The 2nd side of the Extraction Token represents dammage or loss inflicted upon the Objective being Extracted.  The flipped Extraction Token can subsequently be picked up by another Unit in the same manner, but if the Unit carrying the flipped Extraction Token is destroyed, then the Extraction Token is destroyed with it, and the Objective is considered uncompletable.

# Movement

Each unit has a Movement Value and a Fuel Cost indicated on their Unit Tracking Card.  The Movement Value indicates how many squares the unit can move in a single turn.  While the Fuel Cost indicates how many of the Unit's Supplies must be spent for the unit to move this turn.

If a player decides to move a particular unit this turn, they must first remove a number of Supply Tokens from that unit's Tracking Card equal to its Fuel Cost. (If there aren't enough Supply Tokens on the card, that Unit can't move this turn.) After having done so, the unit may move that many squares on the map.  Movement squares, like Attack Range squares are counted orthogonally, (i.e. diagonal movement is not allowed.) And while any Unit moved doesn't need to move its entire Movement Value in its turn, it costs the same number of supplies whether the unit moves it's entire Movement or not.

Certain types of Terrain on the Battlefield also cost more than 1 Movement Value to enter, and other types of Terrain are impassible by Certain Units.  For instance: Forested and Rocky Terrain costs 2 Movement to enter, while Mountainous Terrain costs 3 Movement to enter and is Impassible to any unit except Infantry. Details of these squares, and how they're represented on the map are indicated in the Campaign Map Pack.

> - Sponsorships: Free Units that must be returned at the end of the current battle, and for which losses must be paid for.
> - Investors: An upfront influx of cash which doesn't need to be paid back, but for which the player must pay a dividend at the end of each battle.

The Player may hold 5 Business Opportunity Cards in their hand.  If they draw one with a full hand, they must either play one, or discard one from their hand by shuffling it back into the Business Opportunity Deck.

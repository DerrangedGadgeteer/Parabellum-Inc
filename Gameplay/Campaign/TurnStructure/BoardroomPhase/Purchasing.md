# Purchasing Units

Units are Purchased from the Catalog.  Each Unit has a price in credits, and after paying that price, the purchasing player may place the Unit's Mini into their reserves and its Tracking Card into their play area.  When placing a new Unit's Tracking Card, you also get new supply tokens to fill that Unit's supplies.

To Set up the newly purchased Unit, first take note of the 3 colored pips on the Mini you picked up.  Place matching color indicators on the "Flag" section of the Unit's tracking card.  Next, place the Troop Strength Token on the location indicating 10/10 Troop Strength.  Finally fill all the Supply squares on the Tracking Card with the Tokens that came with the Unit, and place the Unit Mini into your Reserve Area.  The Unit can then be Deployed during the Combat Phase of your next turn.

# Purchasing Supplies

Supply Tokens can be purchased during the boardroom phase and placed into Reserve at a cost of 2 credits per Token.  Tokens purchased this way can be used immediately to Resupply Units in Reserve, and can be used to build out Supply lines and Resupply Units on the Map beginning during the next turn's Combat Phase.

# Reselling Units and Supplies

All Units and Supplies in Reserve can be Resold for Credits.  Supplies can be resold either directly from Reserve, or off of Units in Reserve for 1 credit per token.  Units can be resold at half their Purchase Price, prorated based on their remaining Troop strength, plus 1 credit for each Supply token on it.

> For example, Selling a Standard Infantry Unit at full Supplies and Troop Strength:  The Unit's purchase Price is 100 credits, at full strength, the unit is worth 50 credits plus 10 credits for the 10 Supply Tokens on the Tracking Card. Total: 60 credits

> Another example, selling a Standard Infantry Unit with 6 Supplies remaining and at Troop Strength of 3:  The Unit sells for 15 credits (price: 100, selling value: 50, prorated by 3/10: 15) and the supplies are worth 6 credits. Total: 21 credits

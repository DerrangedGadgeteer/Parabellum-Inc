# Repairing/Reorganizing Units

Units in Reserve which have suffered Losses can be Repaired at a cost of Credits, or Reorganized with other Units of the same type. To Repair a Unit you must pay credits equal to the Unit's Price prorated by the losses it's taken.  A Unit Repaired this way can be Redeployed during the Combat Phase of the next turn, just like any other unit in reserve.

> For example: A Standard Infantry Unit which has suffered 3 losses (Remaining Troop Strength: 7) can be repaired for a cost of 30 Credits. (Unit Price: 100, Losses: 3/10, Total: 30 Credits)

If you have more than one Unit of the exact same type in your reserves, you may Reorganize them.  Reorganizing Units combines two or more Units' Troop Strengths and Supplies into one Unit.  One Unit's Mini and Tracking card is retained, while the other component Unit's Minis and Cards are discarded.  The resultant Unit cannot have more Troop Strength or Supplies than the Unit's maximum, Extra Supplies are moved into Reserve, and Extra Troop Strength is simply lost as waste.

> For example: Two Howitzer Units, One at a Troop Strength of 3 with 4/8 Supplies, the other at a Troop Strength of 5 with 6/8 Supplies.  The Reorganized Unit will have a Troop strength of 8, full Supplies, and 2 Supply Tokens will be left in Reserve.

> Another example: Three Mechanized Units, One at a Troop Strength of 7 with 2/12 Supplies, One at a Troop Strength of 2 with 5/12 Supplies, and One at a Troop Strength of 2 with 1/12 Supplies.  The Reorganized Unit will have full Troop Strength, the extra Troop Strength is lost as waste, and it would have 8/12 Supplies.

# Supplying/Stripping Units

Units in Reserve can be Resupplied with Supplies from the Reserve during the Boardroom Phase.  Units in Reserve can also be Stripped of their Supplies, removing Supply Tokens from their Unit Tracking Card, and placing them either into Reserve or onto another Reserve Unit's Tracking Card.

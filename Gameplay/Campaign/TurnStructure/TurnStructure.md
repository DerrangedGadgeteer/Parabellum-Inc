# Phases of a Turn

Each player's turn is broken up into 2 Phases:
- First: [The Combat Phase](./CombatPhase/CombatPhase.md)
> During the Combat Phase, the player can:
> - Move their Units
> - Attack Enemy Units
> - Deploy Units from their Reserve
> - Extract Units from their Starting Area
> - Resupply Units
> - Build out Supply Lines by placing Supply Tokens on the Board
> - Capture/Interact with Objectives on the map

- Second: [The Boardroom Phase](./BoardroomPhase/BoardroomPhase.md)
> During the Boardroom Phase, the player can:
> - Purchase Units and supplies, placing them into Reserve
> - Resupply and/or repair Units already in Reserve
> - Resell Units and supplies in Reserve for Credits
> - Play Business Opportunity Cards for more Credits or Pay Off Business Opportunity Cards that have already been played

Finally, at the end of the player's turn, after the Boardroom Phase, if the player meets the requirements to do so, the player can draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck.

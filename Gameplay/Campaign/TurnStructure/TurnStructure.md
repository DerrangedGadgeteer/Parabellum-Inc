# Phases of a Turn

Each player's turn is broken up into 2 Phases:
- First: [The Combat Phase](./CombatPhase/CombatPhase.md)
> During the Combat Phase, the player can:
> - Move their Units
> - Attack Enemy Units
> - Deploy Units from their Reserve
> - Extract Units from their Starting Area
> - Resupply Units
> - Capture/Interact with Objectives on the map
- Second: [The Boardroom Phase](./BoardroomPhase/BoardroomPhase.md)
> During the Boardroom Phase, the player can:
> - Purchase Units and place them into Reserve
> - Purchase Supplies and place them into Reserve
> - Resell Units in Reserve for Credits
> - Resell Supplies in Reserve for Credits
> - Build out Supply Lines by placing Supply Tokens on the Board

Finally, at the end of the player's turn, after the Boardroom Phase, if the player meets the requirements to do so, the player can draw a card from the Business Opportunity Deck.

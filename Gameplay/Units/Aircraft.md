# Aircraft

Aircraft work differently from Infantry, Mechanized, or Naval Units.  They don't have a Movement Value, because Aircraft aren't moved around the map like other units, instead they get Called In and Aircraft threaten all squares on the board from wherever they're based, acting as Indirect Fire Units.  

## Basing Aircraft

If the current Battle Map has at least 1 Airbase as an Objective, whichever player has Captured it gets to Base Aircraft Units from their Reserves there.  Basing is similar to Deploying conventional Units, but Aircraft can only be placed on Airbases, and they don't move like other Units.  The Aircraft Mini is placed on a square of the Airbase, and remains there until it's Destroyed or Extracted.  All Aircraft the player controls are available to be Called In by any other Unit as an Indirect Fire Attack.

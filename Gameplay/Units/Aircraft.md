# Aircraft

Aircraft work differently from Infantry, Mechanized, or Naval Units.  They don't have a Movement Value, because Aircraft aren't moved around the map like other units, instead they get Called In and Aircraft threaten all squares on the board from wherever they're based, acting as Indirect Fire Units.  

## Basing Aircraft

If the current Battle Map has at least 1 Airbase as an Objective, whichever player has Captured it gets to Base Aircraft Units from their Reserves there.  Basing is similar to Deploying conventional Units, but Aircraft can only be placed on Airbases, and they don't move like other Units.  The Aircraft Mini is placed on a square of the Airbase, and remains there until it's Destroyed or Extracted.  All Aircraft the player has Based are available to provide their capabilities wherever the player needs it.

> #### Re-Basing or Extracting Aircraft
> If a player wants to move an Aircraft Unit from its current Base, the player must spend the Unit's Fuel Cost in Supplies to do so.  An Aircraft moved this way cannot be Called In until the next turn's Combat Phase.
>
> If a player wants to Extract an Aircraft Unit and return it to their Reserves, they must spend **both** the Unit's Extraction Cost in Credits, as well as it's Fuel Cost in Supplies.  If the Aircraft doesn't have sufficient Supplies, it cannot be Extracted until resupplied.
>
> #### Aircraft Under Attack
> If a Captured Airbase becomes Contested by unfriendly Units, Aircraft Based there cannot be Called-In.  The only things those Aircraft Units can do is Re-Base, or be Extracted.  If a Based Aircraft Unit is within range of a Conventional Unit, it **is** vulnerable to attack.  It's Battle die in this case is a D4, and it cannot make a Counterattack.
>
> If an Airbase with Aircraft Based there is Captured by enemy forces, then those Aircraft are Captured by the Enemy player.  The losing player must Transfer the Unit Tracking card, along with all supplies on it to the enemy player, and the enemy player can, beginning on their next turn, use that Aircraft as their own.

## Calling In Air Strikes

If another Unit is to make an Indirect Fire Attack and a friendly Aircraft Unit is Based on the map, then the player discards **both** the fuel **and** ammunition Cost from the Aircraft Unit's Supplies, and makes the Attack with the Aircraft's Battle Die.  Like with other Indirect Fire Attacks, there is no opportunity for a Counterattack in this case.

## Anti-Air Units

Aircraft can be countered in two main ways: Air Superiority Units, and Conventional Anti-Aircraft Units.

### Conventional Anti-Air Units

Certain Units are designated as Anti-Air Units.  These units have a range and a Battle Die like conventional Units, but they serve to protect that area from Air Strikes.  If an enemy unit Calls In an Air Strike against a friendly Unit within the Anti-Air Unit's range, then the friendly player can spend the Anti-Air Unit's Ammunition Cost and make a Preemptive Attack against the Aircraft.  The Anti-Air Attack is computed **before** the Air Strike is carried out, hopefully reducing the Troop Strength of the Aircraft before attacking the Unit on the ground.

### Air Superiority Units

Aircraft designated as Air Superiority Units cannot be Called In to Attack Conventional Units.  However, they serve as an Anti-Air Unit that threatens every square on the map.  They're Based like any other Aircraft, and like other Aircraft, calling them in costs both Fuel and Ammunition Supplies.  

> #### Degenerate case
> If an Air Strike is called in against a Unit within the range of an Anti-Air Unit friendly to the Attacking player, and the defending player calls in an Air Superiority Unit against the Air Strike, the Attacking player may use one of their Anti-Air Units against the Air Superiority Unit.  In this case, the order of combats goes from last declared to first declared.  i.e.
> - Attacking player's Anti-Air Unit vs. Defending player's Air Superiority Unit
> - Defending player's Air Superiority Unit vs. Attacking player's Air Strike
> - Attacking player's Air Strike vs. Defending player's Unit
>
> If instead of an Anti-Air Unit, the Attacking player chose to use an Air Superiority Unit of their own, the Defending player **can** declare they're using An Anti-Air Unit against the Air Superiority Unit as well.  They could also Call In *another* Air Superiority Unit, which could also be answered by another Air Superiority Unit or Anti-Air Unit from the Attacker, etc. etc.  This is intended, and is resolved (as stated,) from the last declared, up the chain to the first declared.  

## Helicopters and VTOL

If an Aircraft Unit is designated a VTOL Unit, it doesn't require an Airbase to be Deployed.  VTOL Units can also be Based out of the player's regular Deployment Area.  If they're Based out of the Deployment Area, the Mini is placed on a square of the Deployment Area, and occupies it for as long as it's on the Map.  This reduces the number of Units the player can Deploy and/or Extract each turn.

# Infantry Units

Infantry Units represent boots-on-the-ground soldiers, variously equipped for different tasks, they're the slowest Units, the least expensive Units, and they're critical for Capturing and Completing Objectives.

## Movement

Infantry Units have a Movement Speed of 3, but they can traverse any kind of terrain except Open Water.  

## Securing

Infantry Units are necessary to Secure Objectives on the Map.  An Objective is considered Secured if at least one square of it has an Infantry Unit on it, and there are no enemy Units on any of the Objective's squares.

## Capturing

Any Direct-Fire Unit can Attack and Destroy Enemy or Derelict Supply Lines, but only Infantry can Capture them.  To Capture Supply Lines, the Infantry Unit must move onto a Supply Line Square, and as the Unit moves off that square, the Supply Token is moved from the Map, onto the Unit's own Tracking Card.  

# Paratroops and Marines

Special Infantry Units can be bought which have special Deployment Rules.  Instead of Deploying onto the player's Deployment area, these Units can be Deployed to additional places on the map depending on their type.

## Marines

On a Battle Map with Naval Units (Meaning one with Deployment Areas overlapping water squares,) Marines can be Deployed to any Shore square within 5 squares of a friendly Naval Unit.  Marines can also be extracted from any Shore square Adjacent to a friendly Naval Unit.

## Paratroopers

If a player has Captured an Airbase, they can Deploy Paratroops.  Paratroops can be Deployed to any unoccupied square on the Battle Map except directly onto an Objective or an enemy Deployment Area.  

Once the square has been selected for deployment, if that square is in range of an enemy Anti-Aircraft Unit, or if an enemy player has Based an Air Superiority Unit, they can make an Anti-Air Attack against the Paratroops.  This attack is resolved before the Unit is placed on the Map.

## Orbital Drop Troops

Orbital Drop Troops can deploy on any unoccupied square on the Battle Map except directly onto an Objective or an enemy Deployment Area.  Orbital Drop Troops are not subject to Anti-Air Attack.

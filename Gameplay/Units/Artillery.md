# Artillery and Indirect Fire Units

Certain Units, such as Mortar Infantry, Howitzers, and Rocket Launchers don't make attacks directly like other Units.  Instead these Units have extended range and can't initiate an Attack by themselves, they're Called In by other friendly Units.  

## Calling In Artillery

If another friendly Unit threatens an enemy unit, and that enemy Unit is also within the Range of an Indirect Fire Unit, That Unit can, instead of attacking with it's own Battle Die and Supplies, Call In an attack from the Indirect Fire Unit.  In this case, the Indirect Fire Unit spends it's Ammunition Cost in Supplies, and makes an Attack against the enemy Unit using the Artillery's Battle Dice and Troop Strength.  

Indirect Fire Attacks don't allow Counterattacks, neither against the Unit that Called the Attack in, nor against the Indirect Fire Unit that made the Attack.

> #### Optional Rule: Counter-Battery Fire
> If you've got Artillery in Range of Artillery, maybe make the game a real clusterfuck by allowing Counterbattery Counterattacks... Works Like Anti-Aircraft Fire, degenerate cases and all.

> #### Optional Rule: Supressive Fire
> Allow Calling In Artillery for Counterattacking? Works like you'd expect.

## Artillery Under Attack

If an enemy Directly attacks an Artillery Unit, The Artillery Unit's Battle Die becomes a D4, And it doesn't get the opportunity to make a Counterattack.

# Mechanized Units

Mechanized Units represent heavier military equipment, like tanks, armored vehicles, Self-propelled Guns, and similar.  They form the damage-dealing backbone of any army, but they can't replace Infantry for the nitty-gritty of warfighting.

## Movement and Limitations

Mechanized Units have Movement Values between 5 and 10 squares per turn, but they cannot enter Mountainous, Marshy, or Jungle Terrain.  

## Mechanized Marine and Paradrop Units

Extremely specialized Mechanized Units can be deployed in the same circumstances as their Infantry bretheren.  Exception being: Mechanized Units cannot be Deployed on squares that they cannot move over.

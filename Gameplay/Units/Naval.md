# Naval Units

If a Battle Map has Open Water squares on it, as well as Deployment Area squares over Open Water, (or a Seaport as a capturable Objective,) then players can Deploy Naval Units there.  Naval Units are supremely expensive, occupy multiple squares, but move quickly over the water, and can act as Deployment Areas for Marines and even Aircraft on top of their Direct or indirect combat roles.

## Multi-Square Minis

### Movement

larger Naval Units take up multiple squares, (3 or 5) and Movement of the mini is based on the direction of the bow of the ship.  Turning the ship requires 1 movement, turning pivots around the midpoint of the mini and can point the ship in any of the 4 cardinal directions.  Backing the ship 1 unit takes the Unit's entire movement, and in order to turn, proceed backwards, or forwards, every square the ship passes through or occupies must be Open Water.

### Attacking and Defending

The Range of a Naval Unit is counted from any square of the Mini, and correspondingly, any square of the mini is an acceptable target for Enemy Attack.

## Littoral Combat Ships

Littoral Combat Ships have a footprint of 3 squares, and in addition to their Indirect Fire capability, Marines can be Deployed from them, and a single VTOL Aircraft can be Based on them wherever they are on the map.

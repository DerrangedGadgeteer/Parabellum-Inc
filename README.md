# Parabellum-Inc
Parabellum inc. is a resource-management focused war game set in a futuristic galaxy where humanity has spread and colonized worlds across the stars. Giant conglomerate corporations and their PMC affiliates wield the greatest power across the galaxy, and you play the role of an "Executive Sector Manager," a middle-management position that involves coordinating military forces that secure your company's primacy.

## The Premise of Parabellum Inc.

In a game of Parabellum Inc. your task is to direct company assets to achieve military objectives sent down by The Board of Directors.  You are given a meager budget by The Board with which to purchase, supply, and maintain the assets under your command.  There's nowhere near enough money to go around however, and you must use sucesses on the battlefield to both impress The Board and attract Business Partners to fund your operation.  But be careful: money from outside the company comes with strings attached, and if the debts come due when you can't pay, The Board isn't going to be happy.

## How To Play

Parabellum Inc. is played in part with miniatures on a gridded play area called the Battle Map. These represent Units of soldiers and vehicles on a Battlefield. Players move these Units around the Battle Map, use them to Attack Units controlled by the other players, and either Capture or Destroy their Objectives.  Different kinds of Units have different capabilities in terms of how far they can move in a given turn, how capable it is in Combat, and how many resources it requires to do so.  These Capabilities, and the status of each Unit is tracked using a Unit Tracking Card.  Movement is resolved by the Unit's capabilities and the Terrain indicated on the Battle Map.  Combat is resolved by opposing dice rolls, the kind and number of dice determined by the Unit's capabilities.  

Parabellum Inc. is also played in part with Tokens which are played on the Battle Map, as well as on Unit's Tracking Cards.  Tokens represent the Supplies of fuel and ammunition that the Units require, as well as the Supply Lines that get them to where they're needed. The player can place Supply Tokens onto the Battle Map, forming a Supply Line back to their starting area.  If a Unit on the Battle Map is adjacent to a friendly Supply Line, the player can instead place the Supply Tokens onto that Unit's Card, refilling its Supplies and keeping it able to Move and Attack for a few more turns.

However, enemy Units can also move on your supply lines, 

Play is divided into a series of Battles called a Campaign.  Each Battle consists of a map and a set of Objectives.  Once all the objectives of a Battle have been completed, the player with the most funds selects the next Battle.  A player is eliminated if they end a Battle with no funds and outstanding Liabilities, and the winner of a Campaign is the last player with funds remaining.
